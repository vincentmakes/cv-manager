    "bio": "Passionate cloud architect with 12+ years of experience designing and implementing scalable, resilient infrastructure for enterprise clients. I specialize in cloud-native solutions, infrastructure as code, and helping organizations modernize their technology stack.\n\nI believe in building systems that are not just technically excellent, but also maintainable and cost-effective. My approach combines deep technical expertise with a strong focus on business outcomes.\n\nWhen I'm not architecting cloud solutions, you'll find me contributing to open-source projects, mentoring junior engineers, or exploring the Swiss Alps.",
